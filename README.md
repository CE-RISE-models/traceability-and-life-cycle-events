# CE-RISE Traceability and Life Cycle Event

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/TOBEOBTAINED.svg)](https://doi.org/TOBEOBTAINED) [![Schemas](https://img.shields.io/badge/Generated%20Schema%20Files-JSON%2C%20SHACL%2C%20OWL-32CD32)](https://ce-rise-models.codeberg.page/traceability-and-life-cycle-events/)

The Traceability and Life Cycle Events data model captures **dynamic event-based information** throughout a product's journey in the supply chain and its entire lifecycle. This model is part of the CE-RISE Digital Product Passport architecture, focusing specifically on time-stamped events that occur during supply chain operations.

---

## Data Model Structure

This model is designed to be **compatible with GS1 EPCIS 2.0** (Electronic Product Code Information Services), the global standard for supply chain visibility, while extending it with additional fields required for Digital Product Passports. Built using [LinkML](https://linkml.io/), it generates multiple schema formats (JSON Schema, SHACL, OWL).

**Core Philosophy**: This model answers critical questions about product journey and lifecycle:
- **"Where has this product been?"** → Supply chain events and logistics tracking
- **"Who has handled it?"** → Ownership transfers and actor involvement
- **"What happened to it?"** → Value-adding activities and transformations
- **"How did it move?"** → Transportation events during supply chain journey
- **"Can it be returned?"** → Reverse logistics and end-of-life pathways

## Model Boundaries Within CE-RISE Architecture

### What This Model INCLUDES:
- **Supply chain custody and movement events** - All time-stamped events showing product location and status changes
- **Business transaction and ownership transfers** - Legal custody changes and commercial transactions
- **Product transformations during supply chain** - Value-adding activities, processing, packaging operations
- **Actor interactions and responsibilities** - Who handled the product when and in what capacity
- **Transportation and logistics operations** - Movement between locations with carrier and route details
- **Return and reverse logistics pathways** - Product returns, refurbishment routing, and end-of-life collection
- **Supply chain inventory operations** - Stock movements, transfers, and custody changes at facilities (integrated in LogisticsEvents)
- **Packaging hierarchy events** - Aggregation and disaggregation operations for items, cases, pallets, containers (Step 7)
- **Supply chain incidents and exceptions** - Damage, theft, delays, contamination, and other disruptions during operations (Step 8)

### What This Model EXCLUDES (handled by other CE-RISE models):
- **Static product identity and specifications** → `product-profile` model (identity, manufacturing origin, materials, initial import/export data)
- **Diagnostic and test results** → `diagnostic-results` model (service reports, condition assessments, quality test outputs)
- **Usage patterns and maintenance activities** → `usage-and-maintenance` model (how product is used, maintenance schedules, repair records)
- **Environmental impact calculations** → `integrated-lca` model (carbon footprint, resource consumption, impact assessments)
- **Regulatory compliance status and certifications** → `compliance-and-standards` model (regulatory approvals, compliance evidence, certificates)
- **Data quality and provenance metadata** → `uncertainty-and-quality` model (data validation, uncertainty, lineage tracking)
- **Circularity design and end-of-life specifications** → `circularity-and-eol` model (design for circularity, recyclability, material recovery specifications)

**Key Principle**: This model focuses exclusively on time-stamped events and state changes that occur during supply chain operations, from initial market entry through end-of-life collection.

### EPCIS Alignment Strategy

This model adopts and extends the **GS1 EPCIS 2.0 standard** event structure:
- **ObjectEvent** → Maps to our LogisticsEvents (observation of objects at locations)
- **TransactionEvent** → Maps to our OwnershipEvent (business transactions)
- **TransformationEvent** → Maps to our ValueAddingActivityLocation (inputs to outputs)
- **AggregationEvent** → Maps to our AggregationEvents (packaging/unpacking operations)
- **AssociationEvent** → Maps to our ActorTracking (entity associations)

Each event type inherits EPCIS's four dimensions (What, When, Where, Why) and extends them with DPP-specific requirements. This ensures:
- Direct import/export of EPCIS event data
- Compatibility with existing GS1 infrastructure
- Extensibility for circular economy requirements

### Why This Model Beyond Direct EPCIS Usage

**This model provides a DPP-optimized structure for EPCIS events, adding explicit support for reverse logistics (returns, refurbishment, recycling) which EPCIS handles weakly.** Rather than requiring implementers to interpret how EPCIS maps to DPP needs, this model provides that mapping explicitly with clear event categories for ownership transfers, value-adding activities, and end-of-life pathways that are critical for circular economy but not well-defined in standard EPCIS implementations.

### Key Design Principles

1. **EPCIS Compliance**: Core event structure follows GS1 EPCIS 2.0 standard for maximum interoperability
2. **Event-Centric Architecture**: Every entry is a time-stamped event with clear before/after states
3. **Immutable Event Log**: Events are append-only, creating permanent audit trails
4. **Actor Attribution**: Every event links to responsible actors with verifiable identities
5. **Location Precision**: Events include precise location data using GS1 GLN and international standards
6. **Document Linkage**: Events reference supporting documentation without duplicating static data
7. **Standards-Based**: Native support for GS1 (EPCIS, GLN, GTIN), UN/LOCODE, and ISO standards
8. **Extensible**: EPCIS extension mechanism for DPP-specific requirements
9. **Supply Chain Focused**: Captures only supply chain events, not product usage, diagnostics, or compliance activities (handled by other CE-RISE models)
10. **Interoperable by Design**: Events can be directly imported/exported to EPCIS repositories and integrated with existing supply chain infrastructure



### Data Properties

Each class has a corresponding value property (e.g., `name_value`, `company_id_value`) that holds the actual data. All value properties are string type except where specified otherwise.

#### SQL Identifiers

Every data point in the model includes a `sql_identifier` annotation that serves as a unique, machine-friendly database identifier. These identifiers follow a structured namespace pattern to ensure uniqueness across the entire data model:

**Pattern**: `trc_[category]_[specific_name]`

**Features:**
- **Traceability Prefix**: All identifiers start with `trc_` to clearly identify them as belonging to the Traceability and Life Cycle Events data model
- **Hierarchical Namespacing**: Uses category prefixes (`hist_`, `owner_`, `value_`, `actor_`, `logis_`, `reverse_`, `agg_`, `incident_`) to provide context and prevent naming conflicts
- **Database-Friendly**: Uses underscores and avoids special characters for SQL compatibility
- **Unique Across Model**: No duplicate identifiers, even when similar concepts appear in different parts of the hierarchy
- **Reasonable Length**: Abbreviated but meaningful names that balance clarity with practical database usage

**Examples:**
- `trc_hist_event_id` - Event identifier in Product History
- `trc_owner_transfer_date` - Transfer date in Ownership Events
- `trc_value_activity_type` - Activity type in Value-Adding Activities
- `trc_actor_gln` - Actor GLN in Actor Tracking
- `trc_logis_shipment_id` - Shipment identifier in Logistics Events
- `trc_reverse_return_reason` - Return reason in Reverse Logistics
- `trc_agg_parent_id` - Parent identifier in Aggregation Events
- `trc_incident_type` - Incident type in Supply Chain Incidents

This identifier system enables seamless integration with databases and ensures clear data model composition when combining with other CE-RISE data models.
