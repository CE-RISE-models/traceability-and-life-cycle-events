  The Traceability and Life Cycle Events data model captures dynamic event-based information throughout the supply chain journey and entire lifecycle of products, materials, batches, and commodities. This model is part of the CE-RISE Digital Product Passport (DPP) and Digital Material Passport (DMP) architecture, focusing specifically on time-stamped events that occur during supply chain operations. Compatible with GS1 EPCIS 2.0 standard.
